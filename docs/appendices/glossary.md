# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms used throughout the Hatchling documentation. For foundational concepts, see other appendices.

---

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: Set of rules and protocols for interacting with software components. See: [settings_reference.md](../settings_reference.md)

**Appendix**: Supplementary documentation section for foundational or background information.

## C

**CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Text-based interface for interacting with Hatchling through terminal commands. See: [open_a_terminal.md](open_a_terminal.md)

**Container**: Isolated runtime environment created by Docker for running applications.

## D

**Docker**: Containerization platform used to run Hatchling and Ollama in isolated environments.

## E

**Environment Variable**: Configuration setting that can be modified to change application behavior and often set at the system's level (the whole computer).

## F

**Feature**: Distinct capability or function provided by Hatchling or its ecosystem.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Hardware component that can accelerate LLM inference when properly configured.

## H

**Hatch**: The official package manager for the Hatch ecosystem, integrated into Hatchling.

**Hatch Environment**: Isolated workspace containing specific collections of MCP server packages.

**Hatch Package**: A packaged MCP server that can be installed and managed through Hatch.

**Hatch Registry**: Centralized repository of available MCP server packages.

**Hatch Schemas**: JSON schemas for package metadata and validation.

**Hatch Validator**: Tool for validating packages against schema specifications.

**Hatchling**: The main CLI application that provides chat interface with LLM and MCP tool integration.

## I

**Inference**: The process of running a model to generate predictions or outputs.

## L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI model used for natural language processing and generation, run locally through Ollama.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Protocol that enables language models to securely access external tools and data sources.

**MCP Server**: Software component that provides tools and capabilities accessible through the MCP protocol.

**MCP Tool**: Individual function or capability provided by an MCP server.

## O

**Ollama**: Local LLM runtime that provides API access to language models.

## P

**Package**: A distributable unit of software, such as an MCP server or extension.

**PlantUML**: Tool for creating diagrams in documentation. See: [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/en/)

## R

**Registry**: Centralized location for storing and retrieving packages.

## S

**Schema**: Structured definition for validating package metadata.

**Server**: Software that provides services or tools accessible via a protocol.

**Settings**: Configuration options for Hatchling and related tools. See: [settings.md](../settings.md)

## T

**Terminal**: Program for entering CLI commands. See: [open_a_terminal.md](open_a_terminal.md)

**Tool Calling**: Capability that allows LLMs to invoke external functions and tools during conversations.

**Tutorial**: Step-by-step guide for users. See: [tutorials](../users/tutorials/)

## U

**User**: Person interacting with Hatchling or its ecosystem.

## V

**VRAM**: Video memory on GPU cards, important for determining which LLM models can run effectively.
